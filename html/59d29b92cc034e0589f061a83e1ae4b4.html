<div><strong>Chunking</strong>&nbsp;is an analysis of a sentence which identifies the constituents (noun groups, verbs, verb groups, etc.) which are correlated. These are non-overlapping regions of text. Usually, each chunk contains a head, with the possible addition of some function words and modifiers either before or after depending on languages. These are non-recursive in nature i.e. a chunk cannot contain another chunk of the same category.&nbsp;<br /><br />Some of the groups possible are:<br />1. Noun Group<br />2. Verb Group<br /><br />For example, the sentence 'He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only 1.8 billion in September.' can be divided as follows:&nbsp;<br /><br />[NP He ] [VP reckons ] [NP the current account deficit ] [VP will narrow ] [PP to ] [NP only 1.8 billion ] [PP in ] [NP September ]&nbsp;<br /><br />Each chunk has an open boundary and close boundary that delimit the word groups as a minimal non-recursive unit.</div>
